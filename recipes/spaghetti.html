        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This great spaghetti recipe was passed from my grandfather to my dad and then from my dad to me. And now, I'm going to give it to you. Because I love spaghetti and I bet you too.</p>

        <ul>

            <li>1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste</li>
            <li>2 (10.75 ounce) cans condensed tomato soup</li>
            <li>2 1/2 cups water</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
